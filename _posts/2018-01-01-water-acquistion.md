title: "Water Acquisition"
menu-item: "Water Acquisition"
definition: "The withdrawal of groundwater or surface water to make hydraulic fracturing fluids."
water-impact: "Groundwater and surface water resources that provide water for hydraulic fracturing fluids can also provide drinking water for public or non-public water supplies. If, however, multiple oil and gas production wells are located within an area, the total volume of water needed to hydraulically fracture all of the wells has the potential to be a significant portion of the water available and impacts on drinking water resources can occur."
