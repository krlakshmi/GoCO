<em class="emphasize">Residents used every democratic means available to them-meetings, protests, grassroots organizing, citizen science-to spotlight the deteriorating quality of their water. Not only did their concerns go unheard but there was no accountability.</em>

<p class="mt-md-5">The idea for this website came from a civic blook club reading of <a href="http://annaclark.net/the-poisoned-city/">The Poisoned City</a> by Anna Clark and hearing folks discuss oil and gas setbacks.</p>
<p>The Poisoned City centers on Flint's water crisis, the context around how it happened, and the factors that lead to action. It took a coalition of residents, city employees, and university employees a long time to shift the community to action. Citizen Science played a key role.</p>
<p>In the leadup to the 2018 midterm elections, many folks discussed the oil, gas, and fracking setbacks <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Proposition_112,_Minimum_Distance_Requirements_for_New_Oil,_Gas,_and_Fracking_Projects_Initiative_(2018)">proposition</a>. It seemed there was an amount of missing knowledge about the level of risk communities faced around their water when it came to fracking.</p>
<p>Considering the lessons of Flint, that folks in all corners of the community need to be involved and aware, and that it can take a long time to change the trajectory of things, and considering the great information in the EPA's 2016 report on the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/hfstudy">Impact of Hyrdraulic Fracturing on Water</a>, we wanted to make the information actionable for anyone.</p>
