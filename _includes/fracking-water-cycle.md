<h2 class='emphasize'>Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle</h2>
<p>The hydraulic fracturing water cycle has five stages; each stage is defined by an activity involving water that supports hydraulic fracturing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/">Water Acquisition</a> the withdrawal of groundwater or surface water to make hydraulic fracturing fluids;</li>
	<li><a href="/">Chemical Mixing</a> the mixing of a base fluid (typically water), proppant, and additives at the well site to create hydraulic fracturing fluids;</li>
	<li><a href="/">Well Injection</a> the injection and movement of hydraulic fracturing fluids through the oil and gas production well and in the targeted rock formation;</li>
	<li><a href="/">Produced Water Handling</a> the on-site collection and handling of water that returns to the surface after hydraulic fracturing and the transportation of that water for disposal or reuse; and</li>
	<li><a href="/">Wastewater Disposal and Reuse</a> the disposal and reuse of hydraulic fracturing wastewater.</li>
</ul>
