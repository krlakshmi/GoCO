<h2 class="emphasize">EPA Conclusions</h2>
<p>In the near term, decision-makers [YOU!] could focus their attention on the combinations of hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional scale factors that are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts. These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Water withdrawals for hydraulic fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, particularly in areas with limited or declining groundwater resources;</li>
	<li>Spills during the management of hydraulic fracturing fluids and chemicals or produced water that result in large volumes or high concentrations of chemicals reaching groundwater resources;</li>
	<li>Injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, allowing gases or liquids to move to groundwater resources;</li>
	<li>Injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources;</li>
	<li>Discharge of inadequately treated hydraulic fracturing wastewater to surface water resources; and</li>
	<li>Disposal or storage of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in unlined pits, resulting in contamination of groundwater resources.</li>
</ul>
